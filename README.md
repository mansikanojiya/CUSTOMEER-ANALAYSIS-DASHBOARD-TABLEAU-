# CUSTOMEER-ANALAYSIS-DASHBOARD-TABLEAU-
Customer Sales Analysis Dashboard – Tableau Project

An interactive Tableau dashboard built to analyze customer sales data across multiple business dimensions such as state, region, age, gender, time, discount, and quantity.
This project focuses on turning raw sales data into actionable business insights using strong data visualization and analytical storytelling.

🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to help business stakeholders quickly understand:

Where revenue is coming from (State & Region)

Who the customers are (Age & Gender insights)

How sales change over time (Year & Month trends)

How discounts impact quantity ordered

Which product categories perform best across demographics
The dashboard contains the following analytical views:

1️⃣ Total Revenue KPI

A headline KPI showing the overall revenue generated, acting as the primary performance indicator.

2️⃣ Revenue per State (Map Visualization)

Geographic map showing revenue distribution across states

Helps identify high and low performing states visually

3️⃣ Year-wise & Month-wise Sales

Bar chart showing trends across years and months

Useful to identify seasonality and sales growth patterns

4️⃣ Age-wise Sales

Customers grouped into age bins

Shows which age group contributes the most revenue

5️⃣ Region-wise Sales

Pie chart representing contribution from West, Midwest, South, and Northeast regions

6️⃣ Gender-wise Sales by Category

Horizontal bar chart comparing product category preferences between genders

7️⃣ Quantity vs Discount Correlation (Scatter Plot)

Displays how discount percentage affects quantity ordered

Helps analyze pricing strategy effectiveness
